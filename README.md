# BamToolkit

The Bam Toolkit has been dormant for a number of years while the world settles into new ways of doing things, including .NET Core and distributed containerized applications.

The old Bam Toolkit and related framework consists of code that is over 15 years old and in many cases difficult to maintain or update without significant effort.  BamToolkit v2.0 is currently under development and, when complete, will provide a modern, distributed, application development platform.
